# Human-Benchmark-Bots

## Human benchmark was never meant for bots

Bots run on selenium in the python language.

All these bots run on: www.humanbenchmark.com

I will be adding more bots soon. :)

## Extra Credit
The visual memory, aim trainer, and typing test have part of the code or are inspired from [Alorans'](https://github.com/alorans) [AutoHumanBenchmark](https://github.com/alorans/AutoHumanBenchmark)
